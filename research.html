<h2>Location-Sensitive Convolutional Neural Networks for WMH Segmentation in Brain MR Images</h2>
<img src="images/brain.jpg" alt="" title="" style="float: right; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 30px; padding:1px; border: 0px solid #EEE; height: 150px;">
(Sept. 2015)<br>
The anatomical location of imaging features is of crucial importance for accurate diagnosis in many medical
tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have had huge successes in computer vision, but they lack the natural ability
to incorporate the anatomical location in their decision making process, hindering success in some medical image analysis tasks.<br>
In this project, we have addressed this problem, by augmenting explicit location features into the networks, while the weights 
are being learned during the training. We have benchmarked such a strategy applying to the task of white matter hyperintensity
segmentation in brain MR images of a large dataset and compared the proposed architecture with for various multi-scale architectures that 
also aim to capture more contextual information. 
As a result, we observed that the CNNs that incorporate location information substantially outperform a conventional segmentation method with 
hand-crafted features as well as CNNs that do not integrate location information. <br>
<strong>I was personally pretty excited that on a test set of 46 scans, the best configuration of our networks (a hybrid system that utilized  
explicit spatial features as well as multi-scale patches) obtained a Dice score of 0.791, 
compared to 0.797 for an independent expert human observer while no statistically significant advantage of the independent human expert 
was observed (p-value=0.17). </strong>

<h2>Non-uniform patch sampling for Convolutional Neural Networks Applied to WMH Segmentation in Brain MR Images</h2>
<img src="images/focus.jpg" alt="" title="" style="float: right; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 30px; padding:1px; border: 0px solid #EEE; height: 180px;">
(Oct. 2015)<br>
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been reported to be the state of the art in most of visual recognition tasks and in particular in image classification
and object detection. A popular way to extend image classifying CNNs for a segmentation problem is to train them
to predict the label for each voxel given a small patch representing a local neighborhood of that voxel. Nonetheless
the chosen patch size might impose natural limitations hindering success of such segmentation systems in many medical
image analysis applications, where the anatomical location of the imaging features is of crucial importance; small patches
lack enough contextual information, while larger patch sizes, apart from higher computational costs, decrease the localization accuracy. <br>


<strong>
A way to address this problem is to break the unnecessary assumption of uniform patch sampling. The human visual
system also non-uniformly perceives the world, with a lot of details at the focal point but a compact contextual representation
from large areas in the surroundings. Inspired by the way our natural visual system performs, in this project we took non-uniformly
sampled patches to train deep CNNs and we applied such a system for segmentation of WMHs, where a comprehensive inclusion
of contextual information matters for a decent segmentation. We showed that using this sampling approach, a CNN outperforms
similar single-scale and even more complex multi-scale networks that use uniform sampling.

<h2>Automated Temporal Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning using Ant System Algorithm</h2>
<img src="images/RL.png" alt="" title="" style="float: right; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 30px; padding:1px; border: 0px solid #EEE; height: 200px;">
Nowadays developing autonomous systems, that can act in various environments and interactively perform
their assigned tasks, are intensively desirable. Reinforcement learning is an attractive area of machine
learning that addresses these concerns. In large scales, learning performance of an agent can be improved
by using hierarchical Reinforcement Learning techniques and temporary extended actions. In this study, we proposed a new method 
for subgoal states discovery and construction of useful skills. In particular we executed a few iterations of Ant System optimization 
and separated the bottleneck transitions using their specific property that their pheromone concentrations change more smoothly compared to the other 
transitions. Experimental Results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the learning performance of the agent in several 
simulated environments including the Taxi and the Playroom environments.
