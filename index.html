            I am a <strong>Senior Staff Machine Learning Research Scientist</strong>, technical team lead and manager at <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence">Qualcomm AI research</a>, where I focus on developing <strong>efficient video diffusion models</strong>.
		    <br>Previously, I led Qualcommâ€™s Extended Reality team in Amsterdam, developing on-device <strong>efficient 3D scene reconstruction and understanding</strong> features.
			From 2017 to 2021, I worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TomTom">TomTom</a> as a senior deep leaning R&D engineer, technical team-lead and line-manager, where I developed deep-learning-based methods for generating high-definition maps for autonomous driving.<br>
			I earned my Ph.D in machine learning from <a href="http://www.ru.nl/english/">Radboud University</a>, the Netherlands, focusing on machine learning algorithms for detection and characterization of neuro-degenerative diseases (Oct. 2013 - June 2017). 
			I received my Master's degree in Artifical Intelligence from <a href="http://ce.sharif.ir/en" rel="nofollow">Sharif University of Technology</a> in 2012, with a thesis on <strong>hierarchical reinforcement learning</strong>.
