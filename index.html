			I am a Sr. Staff ML researcher, technical team lead and manager at Qualcomm working on augmented/virtual reality applictions. Prior to this 
			I was a senior deep leaning R&D engineer, technical team-lead and line-manager at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TomTom">TomTom</a>, working on automated generation of high-definition maps for autonomous driving. I recieved my Ph.D in machine learning from <a href="http://www.ru.nl/english/">Radboud University</a>, the Netherlands, where I worked on development of machine learning algorithms for detection and characterization of neuro-degenerative diseases (Oct. 2013 - June 2017). 
			My Ph.D. project was in collaboration between the <a href ="http://www.ru.nl/is/ml/" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning </a> and the 
			<a href ="http://diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Home" rel="nofollow"> Diagnostic Image Analysis Group</a>s and was under the supervision of <a href="http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Person?name=Bram_Platel" rel="nofollow">Dr. Bram Platel</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~elenam/" rel="nofollow">Prof. Elena Marchiori</a>, <a href="http://www.diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Person?name=Nico_Karssemeijer" rel="nofollow">Prof. Nico Karssemeijer</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~tomh/" rel="nofollow">Prof. Tom Heskes</a>.
